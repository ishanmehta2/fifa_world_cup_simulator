The purpose of this project was to take data on FIFA world cup teams through qualifying stages and use it to predict the outcome of the 2022 FIFA World Cup. 
I implemented ELO Ratings as the primary form of measurement, along with various probabistic processes such as Poisson Random Variables and Bernoulli. The code is written
entirely in Python and the accompanying CSV file has the data gathered for the project. The writeup provides a summary of the project, including next steps for the work.
